    This is a utility web application that is focused on isolating functionality that is missing from the Support Portal, Exchange, or would serve no purpose in the Enterprise Portal.
    These missing links typically fall in the realm of phone numbers so we're really leaning into enhancing things like: adding the ability to check phone numbers on an entity, check multiple phone numbers' entities, and generating phone numbers for submission in
    the Enterprise Portal.
